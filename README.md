## Notes

For this project, I ran into issues with the API limits for the Spoonacular API. I reached the limit quickly because I didn't understand the point system they use for each API call. Some are 3 points, while others are 1 point or 0.1 points. Their daily max is 150 points, which I reached quickly. Once the daily max had reset, I was able to adjust the number of calls to continue with formatting. 

I also had issues with understanding why another API call was needed in RecipeInfo.jsx. After reviewing the lab, I realized that we are obtaining extra information that the original API call did not have, so that we can include it in our information display.
